# Credit Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) script for a credit dataset. The goal is to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of the data, identify missing values, and perform preliminary data cleaning.

## Project Overview

The EDA process is crucial in identifying patterns, trends, and potential issues within the credit dataset. This analysis provides insights into data quality, helps uncover significant relationships, and sets the foundation for further predictive modeling.

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Library Imports and Configuration**: Imports essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Data Loading**: Reads the credit application data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Inspection**: Provides an overview of the dataset, including column types and non-null counts, to assess data completeness.
4. **Data Quality Checks**: Evaluates the percentage of missing values in each column to identify incomplete data.
5. **Column Filtering**: Drops columns with more than 47% missing values to ensure only reliable data is used for analysis.
6. **Visualization (Optional)**: You can add visualizations to explore relationships among features.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Usage

This script can be run in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment. Ensure that the required dataset file (`application_data.csv`) is in the same directory or update the file path in the code as needed.
